NetCaptchaQ - Prevent Bots In Your Game


### **Hey there, developers!**

*I know some of you might be tired of bots joining your game and ruining the experience, whether it's disrupting gameplay or mostly farming. Well, I've created something that might help! While it could be a bit advanced, I haven’t tested it in a game full of bots yet, so... we’ll see how it goes!*

# **Introducing NetCaptchaQ BETA**

* NetCaptchaQ adds a **captcha system** to your game, stopping bots and ensuring only real players get through! Easy to set up, customizable, and keeps your game fair.

*As of now, there are only 4 captchas, which are randomly selected and spawned for players to solve when they join the game!* -- Customizeable in the SettingsModule
